abstract: A one-dimensional model has been developed to accurately predict the thermal performance and flow non-uniformity of the manifold microchannels (MMC) for embedded liquid cooling. The model consists of one-dimensional governing equations derived from the integral relations of momentum and energy over appropriately-defined two separate control volumes. To validate the model, a series of 3-D numerical simulation is conducted over the wide ranges of the Reynolds number (Re_man,in) at the manifold inlet from 560 to 3190, the dimensionless hydraulic flow length (x+) from 0.012 to 0.123, and the dimensionless thermal flow length (x*) from 0.002 to 0.023. It is shown that the model provides accurate predictions of the thermal performance and flow non-uniformity (CV) of MMC heat sinks within the root mean square percentage error (RMSPE) of 6% and 26% for 50 data points, respectively. The significant improvement of the prediction accuracy is made over the earlier models with an error reduction of 82%. Finally, a design guideline for the uniform flow distribution is suggested for the first time based on a newly proposed explicit correlation for predicting the flow non-uniformity:the dynamic pressure at the manifold inlet should be kept smaller than the pressure drop across the microchannels.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Thermal-hydraulic modeling work for manifold microchannels (MMC) is now published in International Communications in Heat and Mass Transfer. This work accounts for the effect of non-uniform flow distribution on the thermal performance of MMC for the first time. We are looking forward to various derivative works based on the proposed one-dimensional model.
