Today, Jooil Park, CEO of ANSYS Korea, one of the biggest companies offering multiphysics simulation for various applications, visited the campus and talked about how the company's simulation technology benefit the current industry in various fields such as manufacturing, aerodynamics, and electronics, and the future of digital twin. Since our lab has been using the products of ANSYS as a part of our research, I was very excited to meet him and listen to his talk.
