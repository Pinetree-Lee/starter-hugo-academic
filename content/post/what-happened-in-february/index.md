We all know that February is the shortest month of the year, but it wasn't for me. Briefly speaking, I finally graduated from the graudate school in KAIST with master's degree and met with a lot of new people related to my research in this month. Since I submitted my first journal paper last month, I had a little time before revisioning the paper. By using that amount of time, I was planning to deeply think of my next research topic and what problem do I want to solve during my Ph. D. period in the long run. Of course, I'm still trying to find answers for those questions, but I'm definitely sure that this month was invaluable time in my life.

### Graduation ceremony 
On February 16th, KAIST held a graduation ceremony for undergraduate and graduate students. When I was an undergraduate student, the graduation ceremony was not able to be held because of COVID-19. So it was the first time for me to attend the graduation ceremony. (I didn't even know how to put on a graduation gown and cap, so the person next to me taught me how to put on my gown and cap). The weather was clear and not too cold. I took lots of pictures with my family, old friends, my advisor, and colleagues in our lab. I had the most celebrations ever in my life, so the day was still clear and vivid in my mind. Some peple might have heard that the word "commencement" indeed means the beginning of something. I was very happy that I had finally finished one important period in my research career, but at the same time, I was very excited about what unknown events would appear in front of my career and how much I could grow from those events.
