W﻿hile working as an undergraduate research intern in Applied Heat Transfer Lab., I had a chance to have a hands-on experience on IR thermometry and its data processing. Specifically, I conducted calibration of an IR camera using black body radiation and data processing to estimate local heat flux in pool boiling situation using a given temperature distribution.

As embedded cooling schemes have been drawing attention due to the 3 -D stacked semiconductors, researchers are still looking for a type of proper micro fin heat sink. The requirements of a micro fin heat sink for the practical application are as follows. First, it should have a low convective thermal resistance. Second, the pressure drop across the heat sink should be small.

Micro-pin fin heat sink is one of the possible choices for the practical application of embedded cooling schemes since it has a reasonably low convective thermal resistance and low pressure drop. However, it is still unclear how the varying transversal and longitudinal space between pin-fins affects heat transfer. To check the effects of the varying spacing clearly, I conducted the numerical study for the various pin-fin configurations given the same porosity as a final project for ME613 Computational Fluid Mechanics and Heat Transfer.
