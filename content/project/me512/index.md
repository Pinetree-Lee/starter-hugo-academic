With an increasing trend of energy consumption required to cool data centers, designing and implementing efficient and cost-effective cooling schemes are the most urgent issues for sustainable operation of data centers. Since the heat dissipation from server boards in data centers already reached the maximum heat flux which can be coold by conventional cooling schemes such as air cooling, single-phase liquid cooling, adoption of the next-generation cooling scheme is necessary. Immersion cooling scheme is one of the promising approaches for the next-generation cooling scheme. It is capable of relatively high heat flux, and it does not require additional power sources. However,
