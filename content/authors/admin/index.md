Welcome to my website! I graduated from my master's at KAIST in 2024. Currently, I'm preparing for doctoral studies in the U.S. Iâ€™m excited to discover where my journey will take me next year!

My research focuses on advanced thermal management of electronics using silicon-based embedded cooling. Through my research, I aim to overcome a critical bottleneck in the performance of advanced semiconductor packaing and high-performance electronics caused by excessive thermal loads. My research approach integrates thermal & electrical modeling and experimental investigations including MEMS fabrication, bridging fundamental science with practical applications to address thermal challenges in next-generation electronics.

Besides my research, I enjoy playing tennis, reading books, and writing essays about miscellnaeous topics. I also love doing some side projects not related to my major like building my website as you are seeing now.
