I﻿ am a researcher in the **department of mechanical engineering in KAIST**. Currently, my research focuses on thermal management of electronics including power/RF devices based on the wide-band gap semiconductors and 3D ICs. I have been conducting research on an embedded liquid cooling device, which is manifold microchannels (MMC), for high-heat flux dissipating electronics (2022-Present). I'm also interested in thermal-electrical transport in semiconductors and thermal-aware advanced packaging technology.  

Besides my research, I enjoy playing tennis, reading books, and writing essays about miscellnaeous topics. I also love doing some side projects not related to my major like building my website as you are seeing now.
