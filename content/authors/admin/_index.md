I﻿ am a Mechanical Engineering graduate student in **KAIST**. My research focuses on heat transfer, phase change phenomena, and their variety of applications such as thermal management of electronics or sustainable energy. R﻿ecently, I have been conducting research on a embedded cooling device for high flux dissipating electronics.

Besides my research, I enjoy sharing my projects, theories and writing essays about miscellnaeous topics
